    StudentGroupsIntro: 'Swarthmore offers a wide variety of student-run organizations that give students the opportunity to explore their interests and become more deeply integrated in the campus community. SGO officially recognizes student organizations through the chartering process, which occurs each semester. Once a organization is chartered, it maintains its charter as long as it abides by SGO\'s yearly procedures outlined by the Chair of Student Organizations.',

    CharterDescription: 'Any student groups seeking a charter must follow the chartering process. \nMembers of the Student Organizations Committee (Student Orgs)  work with student groups to ensure they meet specific criteria regarding active membership, regularly scheduled meetings, and organized leadership structure. Student Orgs votes to approve the charters of student organizations each semester.',

    PreCharterFundingDescription: 'If your student group is not yet chartered, or currently going through the chartering process, you have the option of requesting seed funding from Student Orgs. For more information and details, please see Step 3 of Chartering Process or send Student Orgs an email at the link below.',

    SBCDescription: 'Student Budget Committee (SBC) has been an institutional committee of Swarthmore\'s student government since 1946 when it began to allocate funds for student groups. At the end of spring semester each year, SBC runs Spring Budgeting, in which all chartered student organizations may propose a budget for the following year. Additionally, SBC has weekly meetings for student groups to propose for additional funding throughout the year as well as office hours throughout the week.',

    SBCFundingDescription: 'Only chartered student organizations are eligible for funding through SBC. A majority of the yearly budget for student organizations is allocated during Spring Budgeting the year before. Throughout the year, you may also request supplementary funding on a proposal basis. Please refer to the Funding Guide linked below for more information on Spring Budgeting and proposing for supplementary funding.',

    EventPlanningDescription: 'Any student or student organization is eligible to propose a campus event and receive funding, services, and space reservations through the online event planning proposal supported by the Office of Student Engagement and Student Government Organization. This system is designed to accommodate any student events that are well planned and have significant student support.',

    EventPlanningSteps: {
        Planning: 'After you have the idea for your event solidified, you must determine if you need additional funding or services such as graphic design from the Office of Student Engagement. If you do not require funding or these services, then you may skip to step four. Otherwise, continue to step two. ',
        Funding: 'To secure funding and/or OSE services for your event you must complete the online event planning proposal. In order for your proposal to be considered, you must submit it on Sunday at 11:59pm at least two weeks before your proposed event, and you must  attend the next proposal meeting on Monday at 6:00pm in the OSE.    ',
        Review: 'Your proposal will be reviewed by funding sources across campus, and you will be notified with the total allocation. If you have any questions or concerns about the amount of funding received, you should contact the OSE for details. ',
        Reserve: 'Now you may reserve space for your event and request student workers. This must be completed at a minimum of one week before your event.',
        Enjoy: 'Enjoy your event! Make sure you are there to ensure everything runs smoothly, and contact the Director of Student Activities with any issues.',
    },
    CharteringSteps: {
        StepOne: 'Only student groups that have active members, consistent meetings, and are in need of funding should consider the chartering process. Please fill out the Statement of Interest to begin the process. The Chair of Student Organizations will contact you for the next step.',
        StepTwo: 'A member of the Student Organizations Committee (SOC) will then be paired with your group for at least two months. This liaison will help ensure your group meets the standards of chartering before you submit your charter for review. If you have not yet heard from your liaison or been paired, please contact Student Orgs.',
        StepThree: 'During this two month period, if your group is in need of immediate funding, you may request an allocation from the SOC. These funds are intended to prove to the SOC that your group is capable of using funding from the Student Activities Budget effectively. The Chair of Student Organizations will communicate the process by which funds may be requested to groups involved in the chartering process.',
        StepFour: 'You are now ready to draft a charter. The deadline for submitting a charter will be around spring break. The Chair of Student Organizations will communicate the exact deadline each year. An example charter document can be found here.',
        StepFive: 'Immediately after this deadline, the SOC will review and vote to approve all applications. If your charter is approved, then your group has officially become a chartered student organization of SGO!',
